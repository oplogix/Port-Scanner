# Port-Scanner

This is a port scanner I created in TCM Security PEH Course, I will be adding more and mine was a little slow, and am looking to add threading.

I am also wanting to add time per port and descriptions for main port from 1-1000 at least and maybe build off more later on just for fun.

Maybe even add some more arguements.
